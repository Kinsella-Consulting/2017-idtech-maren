TO REPLACE TEXTURES:

1. Copy the desired files in the "alternates" folder.
2. Paste textures over existing files in the official "textures" folder.
   (block items go in the "blocks" folder, items go in "items")



MISC

-If you want one of the alternates to be a different texture than what it is named, simply 
change the name of the file to match the texture you will be replacing.

-If the name has _alt in it, you will need to delete this part before copying the file over.

-If you are copying over anything animated, you will need to ALSO copy over the .mcmeta text 
file.
